# City Weather Data Extraction and Analysis Pipeline

<br>

## Objectives
The aim of this project is to build a data pipeline to perform ETL/ELT by extracting weather data via API, loading it into BigQuery using Python, and orchestrating the process with Airflow. Then, Iâ€™ll transform the raw data and create a data model using dbt in BigQuery.

## Transforming in dbt
After loading into BigQuery, it's time to transform the seed dataset into staging dataset. Then logically, I could do more data models based on the business requirements.

```sql

{{ 
    config(
            materialized='table',
            schema='city_weather'
        ) 
}}
